    <div class="stuff" data-type="content"><p>How about compositing bins?
  Compositing bins will help you recycle organic materials.
  It is helpful to classify organic materials in greens and browns.
  Greens are fresh, moist, plant materials (e.g. fruits and vegetables scraps, coffee grounds, tea bags, fresh leaves, grass clippings, etc).
  Browns are dry plan material (fall leaves, shredded paper, straw, wood chips, twigs, etc).</div>
